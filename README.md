# Cat Breed Images Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Description

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of cat breed classification using various convolutional neural network (CNN) models. It is part of the project for the Principles of Artificial Intelligence subject, focusing on model performance evaluation and improvement strategies. Detailed analysis of confusion matrices, training accuracy, and loss trends are included to provide comprehensive insights.

## Overview

Cat breed classification is a challenging task due to the subtle visual differences between breeds. This project employs three popular neural network architectures, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV3Small, to tackle this classification problem. The goal is to analyze their performance, identify areas for improvement, and suggest enhancements.

The selected domain for this project is **Animal subspecies**. The dataset used is the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, filtered into five cat breed classes:

- Abyssinian
- Bengal
- Birman
- Bombay
- British Shorthair

### Attached Files

`00_full_cat_breed_project_colab.ipynb`: Python notebook consisting of the full project implementation, including dataset downloading, dataset preparation, model training, model evaluation, graph visualization, confusion matrix analysis, and final model comparison.

### Confusion Matrix Analysis

Provides a visual summary of the three models. Highlights key metrics, such as correct classifications and misclassifications. Offers detailed insights into error patterns and potential biases in the model.

### Model Performance Comparison

Compares accuracy, mean average precision (mAP), and training times across the three models. Identifies the best performing model based on these metrics.

### Training Accuracy and Loss Trends

Examines the evolution of training and validation accuracy. Analyzes training and validation loss to understand overfitting or underfitting trends.

## Performance Metrics

The performance metrics are generated in the notebook after training the three models.

The results include:

- ResNet50 accuracy, mAP, and training time
- DenseNet121 accuracy, mAP, and training time
- MobileNetV3Small accuracy, mAP, and training time
- Model comparison table
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Training accuracy and loss trends

After running the notebook in Google Colab, the final values will be displayed in the notebook output and saved in `results/model_comparison.csv`.
